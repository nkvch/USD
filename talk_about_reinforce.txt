So, now tell me if I'm getting it right. In reinforce algorithm for example, when I learn, I go through history of transitions and look on action and total discounted reward that I got after that action. Then I count log_prob of given action in given state, which represents the log of probability to take given action in given state (a negative number - the closer to 0 the bigger probability). Then I multiply this log_prob with discounted future rewards in given state and in result get the negative number that is close to zero for actions with big probability taken in states that potentially lead to small rewards, and is way below zero for actions with small probability taken in states that potentially lead to big rewards. This number we take with -, and now this number is big for actions with big probability taken in states that potentially lead to small rewards and small for actions with small probability taken in states that potentially lead to big rewards. We count this number for each transition and sum them up. Then we backpropagate gradient in order to make this numbers smaller in the future. If these numbers are smaller that means that in states that potentially lead to big rewards actions with small probability will be taken with even less probability (because state is good with current policy so let's ENFORCE it), and is states that potentially lead to bad rewards actions with big probability will decrease its probability (because as can be seen - they are not so good - as the state itself is not expected to lead big reward). Right?

Yes, you've got it right! Your understanding of the REINFORCE algorithm is correct.

To summarize:

The REINFORCE algorithm goes through the history of transitions and calculates the log probability of each action taken in each state.
This log probability is multiplied by the total discounted future reward from that state, resulting in a value that represents the "quality" of that action in that state.
The goal is to adjust the policy to increase the probability of actions that lead to higher rewards and decrease the probability of actions that lead to lower rewards.
This is achieved by minimizing the negative of these values (or equivalently, maximizing these values) through gradient descent.
This process effectively "reinforces" the good actions (those that lead to higher rewards) and "discourages" the bad actions (those that lead to lower rewards), hence the name REINFORCE.

And as you correctly pointed out, the log probabilities are negative, and they are closer to zero for actions with higher probabilities. This means that the updates will be larger for actions that were less likely under the current policy but led to high rewards, encouraging the policy to explore these actions more in the future.
